      <p>
        A petition for mandatory disclaimers on AI-generated video and voice
        content
      </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          As artificial intelligence technology advances, we're seeing more
          media content that uses AI-generated video and voice. While this
          technology offers incredible possibilities, it also raises serious
          concerns about authenticity and trust in media.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe that
          <strong
            >all media that uses AI-generated video or voice should be required
            to display a clear disclaimer directly on the content itself</strong
          >, not just in fine print or descriptions that can be easily missed.
          Simply having a chip or pop-up on a sidebar is not enough, if anything
          people have been trained to ignore these kinds of things as we are
          constantly bombarded with ads and pop-ups when surfing online. When
          people are consuming AI generatied content it needs to be stated
          clearly, so that it is almost impossible to miss.
        </p>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Transparency:</strong> People have the right to know when
            they're viewing or listening to AI-generated content
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trust:</strong> Clear labeling helps maintain trust in media
            and prevents deception.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Education:</strong> Proper disclaimers help the public
            understand the increasing presence of AI in everyday media
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Protection:</strong> Vulnerable populations need safeguards
            against misleading content
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What We're Asking For</h2>
        <p>We're calling for legislation that requires:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A clear visual disclaimer
            <span class="highlight">printed directly on any video</span> that
            contains AI-generated content
          </li>
          <li>
            If an ad is only audio and using AI audio generation. An audible
            disclaimer at the beginning of any audio content that uses
            AI-generated voices should be included
          </li>
          <li>
            These disclaimers to be present regardless of platform or medium
          </li>
          <li>
            Penalties for content creators and distributors who fail to properly
            label AI content. As long as a black list for those who have tried
            to pass AI generated video or audio as authentic.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Fighting Misinformation and Deep Fakes</h2>
        <p>
          Implementing mandatory AI disclaimers creates a powerful tool to
          <strong>combat misleading content and harmful deep fakes</strong>.
          Here's how:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal Framework:</strong> With clear labeling requirements
            in place, content that deliberately misrepresents AI-generated media
            as authentic can be
            <span class="highlight">easily identified and banned</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enforcement Mechanism:</strong> Authorities can take swift
            action against unlabeled AI content designed to mislead the public
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deterrent Effect:</strong> Mandatory penalties will
            discourage bad actors from creating and distributing deceptive deep
            fakes
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Public Awareness:</strong> As people become accustomed to
            seeing AI disclaimers, they'll be more likely to question content
            that lacks proper labeling
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This simple regulatory measure provides a practical solution to the
          growing threat of AI-generated misinformation without restricting
          legitimate creative and educational uses of the technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even if you feel you are able to easily detect AI media, that won't
          always be the case. The AI generated video and audio content is the
          worse that we will ever see; AI content is only going to get better
          with time. We also need to think about the groups of people that are
          less aware of AI and how easy it is for them to fall into the trap of
          believing all the content they see is real.
