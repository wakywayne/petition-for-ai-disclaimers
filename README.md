    <h1>Stop Undisclosed A.I in Media</h1>
    <p>
      This is a petition for mandatory disclaimers on A.I generated video and voice
      content. My name is Wayne, and I am deeply concerned about the growing potential for A.I generated content to
      mislead the public—whether this is by influencing poor decisions or by promoting false narratives that could
      incite civil unrest; these risks are no longer hypothetical. A.I video has
      gotten to the point that the top 5% of its content is unrecognizable to most of the population and this number is
      only increasing. A.I ads on social media platforms are already being used to sell you products that are being
      represented by someone who looks like a Dr, but in actuality is a character created by A.I. While we cannot halt
      the
      advancement of A.I media, with your support, we can work toward ensuring that people have a fair opportunity to
      discern what is real from what is artificially created.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        As artificial intelligence technology advances, we're seeing more
        media content that uses A.I generated video and voice. While this
        technology offers incredible possibilities, it also raises serious
        concerns about authenticity and trust in media.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe that
        <strong>all media that uses A.I generated video or voice should be required
          to display a clear disclaimer directly on the content itself</strong>, not just in fine print or descriptions
        that can be easily missed.
        Simply having a chip or pop-up on a sidebar is not enough, if anything
        people have been trained to ignore these kinds of things as we are
        constantly bombarded with ads and pop-ups when surfing online. When
        people are consuming A.I generatied content it needs to be stated
        clearly, so that it is almost impossible to miss.
      </p>

      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Transparency:</strong> People have the right to know when
          they're viewing or listening to A.I generated content
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trust:</strong> Clear labeling helps maintain trust in media
          and prevents deception.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Education:</strong> Proper disclaimers help the public
          understand the increasing presence of A.I in everyday media
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protection:</strong> Vulnerable populations need safeguards
          against misleading content
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What We're Asking For</h2>
      <p>We're calling for legislation that requires:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A clear visual disclaimer
          <span class="highlight">printed directly on any video</span> that
          contains A.I-generated content
        </li>
        <li>
          If an ad is only audio and using A.I audio generation. An audible
          disclaimer at the beginning of any audio content that uses
          A.I generated voices should be included
        </li>
        <li>
          These disclaimers to be present regardless of platform or medium
        </li>
        <li>
          Penalties for content creators and distributors who fail to properly
          label A.I content. As long as a black list for those who have tried
          to pass A.I generated video or audio as authentic.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Fighting Misinformation and Deep Fakes</h2>
      <p>
        Implementing mandatory A.I disclaimers creates a powerful tool to
        <strong>combat misleading content and harmful deep fakes</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Framework:</strong> With clear labeling requirements
          in place, content that deliberately misrepresents A.I generated media
          as authentic can be
          <span class="highlight">easily identified and banned</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enforcement Mechanism:</strong> Authorities can take swift
          action against unlabeled A.I content designed to mislead the public
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deterrent Effect:</strong> Mandatory penalties will
          discourage bad actors from creating and distributing deceptive deep
          fakes
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Public Awareness:</strong> As people become accustomed to
          seeing A.I disclaimers, they'll be more likely to question content
          that lacks proper labeling
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This simple regulatory measure provides a practical solution to the
        growing threat of A.I generated misinformation without restricting
        legitimate creative and educational uses of the technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even if you feel you are able to easily detect A.I media, that won't
        always be the case. The A.I generated video and audio content that we see today is the
        worse that we will ever see; A.I content is only going to get better
        with time. We also need to think about the groups of people that are
        less aware of A.I and how easy it is for them to fall into the trap of
        believing all the content they see is real.
